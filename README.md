# Palmoria-Group-HR-Diversity-Analysis-Dashboard-Power-BI-
This project presents a strategic analysis of gender-based pay disparities across departments and regions within the Palmoria Group. Built in Power BI, the dashboard offers a clear view into pay gaps, departmental imbalances, and regional equity patterns â€” all aimed at driving transparent, data-informed decisions to support diversity and inclusion.
## Tools & Techniques
**Microsoft Power BI**
- Power Query Editor for data transformation and cleaning  
- DAX measures for calculating salary gaps and gender-based aggregates  
- Relationship modeling across regions, departments, and roles  
- KPI cards, bar charts, table visuals, and percentage deltas  
- Slicers for interactive filtering by region, department, and job level  
## Power BI Analysis Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   Used Power Query to handle nulls, data type corrections, and standardization  
2. **Data Modeling**  
   Created relationships between employee salary, gender, region, and department  
3. **Metric Calculation**  
   Defined measures for average salary by gender, pay gaps, and percent differences  
4. **Visualization Design**  
   Built a responsive layout using DAX-driven KPIs, tables, and comparison visuals  
5. **Insight Formulation**  
   Extracted cross-cutting insights by layering department, region, and salary data  
## Key Observations
- **National Pay Gap:** $2,455 average difference in salary â€” favoring men by 3.19% across all departments  
- **Region-Level Gaps:**  
  - *Abuja* has the widest gender gap (3.39%)  
  - *Lagos* shows the narrowest (2.73%) â€” signaling better equity  
- **Department-Level Trends:**  
  - *Human Resources*, *Business Development*, and *Services* show significant male pay advantage (8â€“10%)  
  - *Engineering*, *Marketing*, and *Training* favor women, with pay gaps up to -11.31%  
- **Salary Inequity Hotspots:**  
  - Staff earning below minimum wage are concentrated in *Support* and *Services* departments  
  - *Abuja* exhibits lowest average pay and widest gender gap  
## Strategic Insights
- **Regional Salary Strategy:** Regional pay structures lack alignment â€” especially in Abuja, where both total pay and gender disparity need review  
- **Departmental Equity Checkpoints:**  
- Male-dominant gaps in HR and Business Development suggest bias in promotion or pay progression  
- Engineeringâ€™s reverse gap may indicate successful equity practices worth modeling elsewhere  
- **Minimum Wage Risk:** Visible noncompliance suggests the need for compliance reviews in low-paying departments  
## Recommendations
| Focus Area | Strategic Action |
| **Pay Structure Audit** | Standardize pay policies across departments and regions |
| **HR & Business Development** | Conduct salary band audits and promotion equity assessments |
| **Highlight Equity Champions** | Share best practices from Engineering and Marketing |
| **Regional Alignment** | Focus DEI policy improvements in Abuja |
| **Minimum Wage Compliance** | Launch immediate remediation in Support & Services departments |
